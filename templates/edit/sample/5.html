It has quickly become a fun and easy way for Canadians to celebrate dad and help the 1 in 7 men who will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime.</p><p>Next year, for the fourth year in a row, we’re expecting thousands of workplaces and individuals from across Canada to Go Plaid through donations, fundraising and events. The&nbsp;Friday&nbsp;before Father’s Day is officially designated as the day to wear Plaid for Dad. Participants will share photos online using the hashtag #PlaidforDad to show their support and help spread the word.</p><p>Be part of this incredible fundraising campaign!

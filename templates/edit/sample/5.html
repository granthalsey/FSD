    <h1>?Mission &amp; Vision of NOCC</h1>
    <p>The mission of the NOCC is to <em>save lives by fighting tirelessly to prevent and cure ovarian cancer and to improve the quality of life for Survivors.</em><br><br>More than 22,000 women in the United States are diagnosed with ovarian cancer each year, and over 14,000 women die from the disease. Unfortunately, most cases are diagnosed in later stages, when the prognosis is poor. However, if diagnosed and treated early, when the cancer is confined to the ovary, the five-year survival rate is over 90 percent. That is why it is imperative that the early signs and symptoms of the disease are recognized, not only by women, but by their families and the healthcare community.</p>
